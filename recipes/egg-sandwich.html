    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy egg sandwich delivers a satisfying breakfast in 5 minutes with minimal cooking.</p>
    <p>Use whatever bread and cheese you have on hand. Avoid crowding the pan, so make 1-2 sandwiches at a time if
        necessary.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2-4 slices Bread (I used 2 slices of garlic naan)
        <li>
            4 medium Eggs
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoon butter salted butter (if unsalted butter, add a sprinkle of salt optionally)</li>
        <li>6 slices cheese (I used sliced gruyère)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Salt (season to taste)</li>
        <li>2 grinds Black pepper (freshly ground if possible)</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat the pan over medium-high heat. Melt half the butter in the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, crack the eggs into the hot pan. Discard the eggshells.</li>
        <li>Fry the eggs until the egg whites have turned opaque white and are no longer translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Flip each egg over.</li>
        <li>Allow the eggs to cook for about 1 minute until the egg whites on the undersides are set. I like my egg
            yolks
            runny so we remove the eggs before the yolks are hard.</li>
        <li>Move the eggs to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining butter to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the bread to the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the bread on each side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese to allow it to melt on the hot bread. Remove from the bread from the pan when the bread
            reaches
            your preferred level of toasted brown.</li>
        <li>Add 2 eggs to each slice of bread. Close the sandwich with the remaining bread if you fried 4 slices of
            bread.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy your one-pan egg sandwiches!</li>
    </ol>
