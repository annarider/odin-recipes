    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy chocolate cake recipe uses silken tofu and chocolate chips. No eggs, dairy, or animal products. It uses
        common baking ingredients (no weird ingredients from specialty shops), and you can add flavoring twists.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5.3 oz. Flour (I used all-purpose flour, about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt (about ¼ teaspoon)</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil (Use a neutral oil—unless you want the oil to flavor the cake, e.g. olive oil)</li>
        <li>1 lb. silken tofu (I use soft silken tofu)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>8.8 oz. chocolate chips (I prefer 70% cacao chocolate chunks or baking chocolate work, about 1.5 cups)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350° F/175° C.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Mix the dry ingredients</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly to combine.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the silken tofu</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the tofu into large cubes.</li>
        <li>Purée the silken tofu in the blender until the tofu is a creamy consistency with the texture of custard. You
            may need to use a spatula to push down the sides of the blender for an even purée.</li>
        <li>Pour the tofu purée into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and oil to the tofu.</li>
        <li>Mix well to combine the tofu, vanilla, and oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the chocolate</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Zap the chocolate chips in a microwave for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir the chocolate chips to melt them. Zap in the microwave for another 30 seconds if necessary. Repeat
            until the chocolate chips are fully melted. You should have a shiny, smooth consistency.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the cake batter</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the melted chocolate into the tofu-vanilla mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix until the melted chocolate is thoroughly combined into the tofu.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour mixture into the bowl with the chocolate-tofu mixture.</li>
        <li>Fold the flour into the chocolate-tofu mixture until just combined. Avoid over mixing because you don't want
            the cake to end up tough.</li>
        <li>Prepare your cake pan. Grease the pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Add the cake batter into the pan. The batter will be very thick.</li>
        <li>Smooth the surface of the batter to make it as flat as possible. If you're struggling to smooth out the
            batter because the mixture is too stiff and cold, place the cake pan in the oven for 2 minutes. Remove after
            2 minutes and the chocolate should have softened enough to allow you to smooth down the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake the cake for 25 minutes. Test the doneness after 25 minutes by inserting a cake tester (butter knife,
            paring knife, toothpick all work). The cake is done when the knife comes out mostly clean with a few crumbs
            sticking to it.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your chocolate cake!</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
