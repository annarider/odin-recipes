    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3.5 oz. oyster mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 sprig Green onion</li>
      <li>1 medium Shallot</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>3 strips Bacon</li>
      <li>8 medium Eggs or 6 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon Black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Chop the mushrooms roughly. Slice the green onions, shallots, garlic,
        and bacon into small pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crack the eggs into a bowl, and discard the shells. Beat the eggs with a
        hand mixer until the egg whites and yolks are fully combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sour cream and heavy whipping cream to the eggs. Add the salt
        and pepper. Beat until the cream is combined with the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your pan isn't nonstick and you want to try the parchment paper
        method, prepare the parchment paper for your pan. Heat your pan over
        medium-low heat. Add the oil to the pan with the sliced shallots and
        garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the shallots and garlic until they are sizzling. They should start
        turning brown on the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the slices of bacon in a single layer over the shallots and garlic.
        Check the heat. Make sure it's hot enough to hear the bacon sizzle but
        not so hot that the paper is turning brown. Lower the heat if it's too
        hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the bacon to ensure it cooks on all sides. Cook until the bacon is
        beginning to brown on the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped mushrooms. Stir to mix the mushrooms with the bacon. The
        salt from the bacon should cause the mushrooms to release water. If
        you're not using bacon, and your ingredients aren't salty, sprinkle a
        pinch of salt over the mushrooms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until the mushrooms have shrunken significantly in size. If using
        pink oyster mushrooms, they are cooked when they turn gold in color.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the eggs and cream into the pan.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the sliced green onions over the eggs.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the pan with a lid. Turn the heat down to low. Allow the eggs to
        cook until the quiche has solidified. It took me about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the lid to peek at the eggs. If the quiche looks solidified (or
        it is slightly wet and wobbly in the middle), the quiche is done. If
        it's still wet, return the lid to the pan and cook until the eggs are
        solidified.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the eggs are cooked, remove the quiche from the pan to stop it from
        cooking further.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the quiche to rest for 1-2 minutes. The eggs may deflate during
        this time. This is normal.
      </li>
      <li>Slice the quiche to serve.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your mushroom quiche!</li>
    </ol>
